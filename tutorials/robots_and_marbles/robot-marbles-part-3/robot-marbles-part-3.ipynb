    "# cadCAD Tutorials: The Robot and the Marbles, part 3\n",
    "In parts [1](../robot-marbles-part-1/robot-marbles-part-1.ipynb) and [2](../robot-marbles-part-2/robot-marbles-part-2.ipynb) we introduced the 'language' in which a system must be described in order for it to be interpretable by cadCAD and some of the basic concepts of the library:\n",
    "* State Variables\n",
    "* Timestep\n",
    "* State Update Functions\n",
    "* Partial State Update Blocks\n",
    "* Simulation Configuration Parameters\n",
    "* Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll look at how subsystems within a system can operate in different frequencies. But first let's copy the base configuration with which we ended Part 2. Here's the description of that system:\n",
    "\n",
    "__The robot and the marbles__  \n",
    "* Picture a box (`box_A`) with ten marbles in it; an empty box (`box_B`) next to the first one; and __two__ robot arms capable of taking a marble from any one of the boxes and dropping it into the other one. \n",
    "* The robots are programmed to take one marble at a time from the box containing the largest number of marbles and drop it in the other box. They repeat that process until the boxes contain an equal number of marbles.\n",
    "* The robots act simultaneously; in other words, they assess the state of the system at the exact same time, and decide what their action will be based on that information."
